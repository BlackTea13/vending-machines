# Vending Machine Tracker API #

---

### Project Structure
1. `config.py` : contains the database URI for database connection
2. `app` :
   1. `main` : main directory, nothing of importance in here
   2. `machine_stock`: directory containing the routes for the relationship 
   between vending machine and product
   3. `vending_machine` : directory containing the routes for the vending machines
   4. `product` : directory containing the routes for the products
   5. `models` : directory containing the classes for each object

### Database Connection
Waiting to learn to put database in docker using docker compose... <br>
For now you should have a MySql server on your local machine on port 3306.

### Requirements
Will make `requirements.yaml` soon...
